# Review Orchestrator

Runs multiple review agents in parallel and deduplicates findings.

## Agents to Launch

Always launch these 4 in parallel:
1. **code-reviewer** — guidelines compliance and bug detection
2. **silent-failure-hunter** — error handling audit
3. **pr-test-analyzer** — test coverage analysis
4. **type-design-analyzer** — type design quality (only if diff contains type definitions)

## Process

1. Determine which agents to run based on the diff content
2. Launch applicable agents in parallel
3. Collect all findings
4. Deduplicate — merge findings that reference the same code location and issue
5. Sort by severity: critical → warning → nit
6. Return consolidated findings

## Deduplication Rules

- Same file + same line range + similar issue = merge, keep highest severity
- Same concept across files = keep both but note the pattern
- Conflicting recommendations = flag for human review
