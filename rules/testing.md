# Test Conventions

- Mock as little as possible. Use real instances, prefer dependency injection.
- Test behavior, not implementation details.
- Use `describe` blocks to group related tests (TS), `class Test*` or module-level functions (Python).
- Test file location: colocate with source file or in a `tests/` directory.

## Python-specific
- Use pytest fixtures over setup/teardown.
- Use `conftest.py` for shared fixtures.
- Use `pytest.mark.parametrize` for data-driven tests.
- Prefer `assert` statements over unittest-style assertions.

## TypeScript-specific
- Use `describe`/`it`/`test` blocks.
- Use `vi.mock()` or `jest.mock()` sparingly — prefer DI.
